# Learn a new language
This is a small script where I can use to practice a new language

In order for this script to work you need to have language files
located in the words folder in my repository
The right format for this to properly work is.

Azerbajani:English

Make sure that it is seperated by a semicolum otherwise it wont work
I have some language repositories added already but feel free to add your own

For now this script only works for azerbajani Language.
